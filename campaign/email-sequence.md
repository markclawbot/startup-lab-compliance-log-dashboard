### Email 2: Feature Spotlight - Predictive Alerts (Day 3)

**Subject:** This feature catches problems before auditors do 🔮

**Preview:** See how predictive alerts saved one facility during a surprise audit

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Hope you're settling in! By now you've probably seen the dashboard and compliance tracking.

Today, I want to show you our most powerful feature: **Predictive Alerts**.

**Here's why it matters:**

Most compliance tools tell you what HAPPENED.
ComplianceOS tells you what's ABOUT TO happen.

**Real example from a customer:**

Mary Rutan Hospital got a surprise Joint Commission audit with 48 hours notice.

Instead of scrambling, they clicked into ComplianceOS and saw this alert:

🚨 "Ventilator #12 PM overdue in 3 days — 85% of overdue PMs lead to audit flags"

They scheduled the PM immediately. When auditors asked about that exact equipment two days later, they had fresh documentation ready.

**Result?** Passed with zero findings.

**Your turn:**

Check your Alerts tab in ComplianceOS. You'll see:
- Equipment PMs coming due
- Cleaning zones that need attention
- Staff training deadlines

Click any alert to take action instantly.

[CTA Button: View My Alerts →]

P.S. Predictive alerts alone save our customers $50K+ per year in avoided penalties. Worth exploring!

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)

**Subject:** How this 150-bed hospital went from 20 hours → 20 minutes of audit prep

**Preview:** Customer story: Regional hospital passes Joint Commission with zero findings

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend preparing for audits?

For most mid-sized facilities, it's 15-20+ hours compiling:
- Cleaning logs (often incomplete)
- Equipment maintenance records (scattered across spreadsheets)
- Staff training documentation (email threads and paper certificates)

**One customer changed that:**

[Hospital Name], a 150-bed regional hospital, was in the same boat. Their Director of Environmental Services told us:

> "We'd spend weeks before an audit scrambling to find everything. It was stressful, time-consuming, and we always worried about missing something."

**Here's what changed with ComplianceOS:**

✅ Equipment now logs itself automatically
✅ Predictive alerts catch problems 30 days early
✅ Audit reports generate in 20 seconds

**Their result?**

"We went from 20 hours of audit prep to 20 minutes. Our staff love the instant results, and building reports is very easy. I'd recommend ComplianceOS to anyone."

**The best part?**

They passed their last Joint Commission inspection with ZERO findings.

→ Avoided audit penalties
→ Equipment downtime reduction
→ Net savings vs. ComplianceOS cost

- **Avoided penalties:** $50K/year (1 prevented failure)
- **Equipment downtime reduction:** 30% ($15K savings)
- **Total value:** $104K/year

### Email 2: Maximize Your Investment (Day 7)

**Subject:** Are you getting the most out of ComplianceOS? 💡

**Preview:** 5 pro tips from our power users

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Hope your first week with ComplianceOS Pro has been great!

I wanted to share 5 tips from our power users — facilities that squeeze every drop of value from the platform.

**1. Set up email alerts for your team**

Go to Settings → Notifications and add team members. They'll get alerts for:
- Overdue PMs
- Upcoming deadlines
- Flagged compliance issues

This keeps everyone in the loop without logging in.

**2. Use the mobile app for on-the-go logging**

Your EVS staff can log cleaning activities from their phones. Download the ComplianceOS app (iOS/Android) and enable QR code scanning for equipment.

**3. Customize your compliance thresholds**

Under Settings → Compliance Rules, you can set custom thresholds for your facility (e.g., "Flag equipment PMs 7 days before due" instead of default 3 days).

**4. Share reports with stakeholders**

When you generate an audit report, click "Share Link" to send a view-only link to your COO, compliance committee, or board members.

**5. Benchmark against similar facilities**

If you're on Pro with multiple locations, use the Multi-Location Dashboard to see which facility is performing best — then share their best practices.

**Want a personalized walkthrough?**

Your CSM ([CSM Name]) can show you these tips and more in a live session.

### Email 3: Case Study Inspiration (Day 14)

**Subject:** How this facility went from inactive → audit-ready in 30 days

**Preview:** Real story from a customer who turned it around

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a story that might resonate with you.

**Customer: [Similar Facility]**

They signed up for ComplianceOS 3 months ago, set up a few equipment assets, then... stopped using it.

Sound familiar?

Two months later, they got notice of a surprise Joint Commission audit in 30 days.

**Panic mode.**

They called us and said: "We signed up for ComplianceOS but never fully implemented it. Can you help?"

**Here's what we did:**

Week 1: 1-hour setup call to import all equipment and set PM schedules
Week 2: Trained EVS staff on mobile logging
Week 3: Generated mock audit reports to verify completeness
Week 4: Audit happened — they passed with zero findings

**Their Director of EVS told us:**

> "I almost canceled ComplianceOS because we weren't using it. But once we committed to the setup, it saved us during the audit. Worth every penny."

**You can have the same outcome.**

Let's get your facility fully set up. Book a call with me:

[CTA Button: Schedule Setup Call →]

Or if you've decided ComplianceOS isn't the right fit, let me know and I'll help you cancel without hassle.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 4: Final Offer (Day 21)

**Subject:** Last chance: 50% off next month if you re-engage today

**Preview:** We want to keep you as a customer — here's our best offer

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times but haven't heard back. I want to be direct:

**I think you're about to cancel ComplianceOS.**

And honestly, I'd understand if you did — you're not using it, so why pay for it?

**But here's the thing:**

I believe ComplianceOS can help your facility. And I think the reason you're not using it is because you hit a roadblock during setup and didn't have time to figure it out.

**So here's my offer:**

If you book a setup call with me in the next 7 days, I'll:

1. **Give you 50% off next month** ($150 instead of $300)
2. **Do a full setup for you** (1-hour call, I'll do the heavy lifting)
3. **Create a custom implementation plan** for your facility

[CTA Button: Claim This Offer →]

**If you're not interested, no hard feelings.**

Just hit reply and say "Not interested" and I'll cancel your account without any pushback.

Either way, I hope your facility finds a compliance solution that works for you.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. This offer expires in 7 days. After that, I'll assume you're not interested and stop reaching out.
