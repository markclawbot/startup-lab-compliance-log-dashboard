## Problem Section

### Headline
**Manual Compliance Documentation Is Killing Your Team's Productivity**

### Body
Mid-sized medical facilities face intense regulatory scrutiny from Joint Commission, CMS, FDA, and OSHA. But current solutions are either:

- ❌ **Manual systems** (paper logs, spreadsheets) that are time-consuming, error-prone, and create last-minute audit panic
- ❌ **Enterprise CMMS platforms** that are too complex, expensive, and slow to deploy for mid-sized facilities
- ❌ **Fragmented point solutions** (cleaning tools OR equipment tools) that force you to manage multiple disconnected systems

The result? Your EVS and biomedical teams spend hours on documentation instead of patient care. Compliance gaps expose you to audit failures and fines. And manual processes can't catch problems before they become violations.
