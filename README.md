**Live Demo:** [View Prototype](https://nmarkman.github.io/startup-lab-compliance-log-dashboard/)

## Overview

This is a functional prototype of **ComplianceOS** — a compliance operating system for mid-sized medical facilities that automates documentation, predicts violations, and keeps facilities perpetually audit-ready.

## Features Demonstrated

- ✅ **Real-Time Compliance Dashboard** — Instant visibility into facility compliance status
- ✅ **Hero Compliance Metric** — 96% compliant score with visual status indicators
- ✅ **Predictive Alerts** — AI-powered alerts that flag potential violations before audits
- ✅ **Compliance Trend Visualization** — 30-day trend chart showing compliance history
- ✅ **Equipment Status Tracking** — Real-time status of all equipment (compliant, needs attention, scheduled)
- ✅ **One-Click Audit Reports** — Simulated report generation workflow
- ✅ **Multi-Location Dashboard** — Enterprise view for regional health systems
- ✅ **Recent Activity Feed** — Live stream of compliance activities

## Design Philosophy: "Clinical Confidence"

This prototype embodies the "Clinical Confidence" design philosophy:

- **Breathing room** → Generous whitespace and unhurried layouts
- **Confidence over sterility** → Warm teals and greens instead of cold blues
- **Glanceability** → Large hero metrics for instant understanding
- **Asymmetric stability** → Dynamic layouts instead of rigid grids
- **Transparency** → Show evidence and context upfront, not hidden behind modals

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup
- **CSS3** — Custom design system with CSS variables (no frameworks)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Interactive behaviors and chart rendering
- **Chart.js** — Compliance trend visualization
- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first CSS with breakpoints at 768px, 1200px
